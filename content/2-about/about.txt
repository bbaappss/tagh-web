Title: About

----

Text: Are two Ohio born and raised high school friends reuniting on air after five years apart in Los Angeles, CA. Brandon, a web developer, and Josh, a film editor, reminisce, share ideas and argue semantics while offering each other and their listeners boosts of confidence through encouragement and respect. Covering topics from the professional and personal lives of Josh, Brandon, and their peers, Things Are Gonna Happen is an emotionally comprehensive show that entertains fits of nostalgia, is optimistic about the future, and invites its listeners to be in on the joke.
